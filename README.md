### What I learned

ðŸ’¡I found the hint for the chrome extension PerfectPixel. Without having the figma design files, I tried to get as close as possible to the design template with the help of the extension.

ðŸ”Ž I also used the clamp() function for padding. This allows to ensure that the padding is larger on larger screens and automatically becomes smaller on smaller screens without explicitly using media queries.

### Useful resources

- [PerfectPixel](https://www.welldonecode.com/perfectpixel/) - Start developing websites with per-pixel accuracy! Create as many overlays as you need. No Image size restrictions. Separate for each domain. Saved between browsing sessions.
